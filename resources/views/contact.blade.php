            <p>Robert Frost is one of the most famous poets from the 1900s. He never earned a formal college degree, 
                but he did receive honorary degrees from more than 40 colleges and universities. This famous poem shows 
                that everything in life is cyclical and that the beauty in nature only lasts for a short period of time.
                 Even though life ends, there is new life waiting to come forth. </p>
